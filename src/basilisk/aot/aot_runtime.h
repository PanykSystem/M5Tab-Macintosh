/*
 *  aot_runtime.h - Ahead-of-time translated 68k code
 *
 *  tools/aot/aot_translate.py turns hot 68k code whose bytes are known in
 *  advance into ordinary C++ functions ("regions") at build time. No code is
 *  generated at run time. A region is entered through an entry point: the
 *  first opcode of the 68k code is replaced with an unused opcode whose
 *  handler is the translated function.
 *
 *  ROM regions are installed once by AotInstall(), after it has checked that
 *  the ROM holds the bytes each region was translated from.
 *
 *  RAM code is translated as position-independent modules. A module is
 *  installed where AotRamSample() finds its code executing, after checking
 *  every byte of it. Entering an installed module is only a comparison while
 *  the guest has not flushed the instruction cache since the last check
 *  (AotCodeChanged()); after a flush the bytes are checked again. This is
 *  the contract the guest already keeps with a 68040: code that was changed
 *  is not executed until the cache has been flushed.
 *
 *  See EMULATOR_PERFORMANCE.md.
