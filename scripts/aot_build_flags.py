"""
Compiler flags for the translated code (src/basilisk/aot/aot_rom_generated.cpp).

The firmware copies that code to PSRAM and runs it there, so it must not
depend on where it lies:

  -fno-jump-tables       a jump table holds the addresses the code was linked
                         at, and would lead back into the copy in flash
  -fno-toplevel-reorder  keeps the functions between the two markers that
                         bracket them, in the order they are written

tools/aot/check_blob.py checks the result after linking.
